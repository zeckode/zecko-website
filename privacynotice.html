                <h2><strong>Does Zecko Share Your Personal Information?</strong></h2>
                <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our customers&rsquo; personal information to others. We share customers&rsquo; personal information only as described below and with Zecko and subsidiaries that Zecko controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Sellers:</strong>We make available to you products provided by our partner sellers for use on or through Zecko Services. We share customers&rsquo; personal information related to those transactions with that seller.</li>
                <li><strong>Retailer:</strong>We share customers&rsquo; personal information with the retailer on whose platfrom the transaction was completed. Retailers use the data to show you more relevant content and services on their own platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that Ametsa Global Private Limited or any of its affiliates, or substantially all of their assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Protection of Zecko and Others:</strong>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Zecko, our users, or others.

                </ul>
                <h2><strong>How Secure Is Information About Me?</strong></h2>
                <p>We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.</li>
                <li>We work with registered Payment Gateways who follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling payment card data.</li>
                <li>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, processing, and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.</li>
                <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices and applications. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2><strong>What Information Can I Access?</strong></h2>

                <h2><strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong></h2>

                <li>The Help feature on most browsers and devices will tell you how to prevent your browser or device from accepting new cookies or other identifiers, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to block cookies altogether. Because cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of Zecko Services, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

                <p>Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>
